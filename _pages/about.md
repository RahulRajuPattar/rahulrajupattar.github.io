I am absolutely delighted to meet you here. I am a mathematician working on analysis of hyperbolic partial differential equations. I recently completed my PhD from the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, [Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning](https://www.sssihl.edu.in).

Research Themes:
======

1. Singular hyperbolic Cauchy problems
1. Microlocal analysis
1. Pseudodifferential operators
