I am absolutely delighted to meet you here. I am a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Centre for Applicable Mathematics [TIFR-CAM](https://www.math.tifrbng.res.in), working on analysis of partial differential equations. I completed my PhD from the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning [(SSSIHL)](https://www.sssihl.edu.in),  in May, 2022.

Research Interests:
======

1. Well-posedness and propagation of singularities for Hyperbolic Cauchy problems
1. Inverse problems for partial differential equations
1. Integral Geometry
1. Microlocal analysis and Pseudodifferential operators 
1. Quantitative or Mathematical Finance
