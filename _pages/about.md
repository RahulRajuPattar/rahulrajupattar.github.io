I am absolutely delighted to meet you here. I am a quantitative researcher at NX Block Trades, focusing on research and development of quantitative finance-based technology and strategies for trading in financial markets. 

With a solid foundation as a trained applied mathematician, I have extensive research experience in the mathematical analysis of partial differential equations (PDEs) modeling physical applications. I was  postdoctoral researcher at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Centre for Applicable Mathematics [TIFR-CAM](https://www.math.tifrbng.res.in), working on inverse problems related to partial differential equations and integral geometry. I completed my PhD from the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning [(SSSIHL)](https://www.sssihl.edu.in),  in May, 2022.

My Erdős number is 4: Paul Erdős -> Svante Janson -> Jan Boman ->  Venkateswaran P. Krishnan ->  Rahul Raju Pattar.
My Einstein number is 7: Albert Einstein -> Peter Gabriel Bergmann -> Michel Cahen -> Lieven Vanhecke ->  David E. Blair ->  Ramesh Sharma ->  Uday Kiran, N. ->  Rahul Raju Pattar.

Research Interests:
-------------------------

1. Quantitative or Mathematical Finance
1. Well-posedness and propagation of singularities for Hyperbolic Cauchy problems
1. Inverse problems for partial differential equations and Integral Geometry
1. Microlocal analysis and Pseudodifferential operators
