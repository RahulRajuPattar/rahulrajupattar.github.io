Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics developed to solve a system of linear equations and has found many applications in applied sciences- computer science(image processing) and mathematical finance(portfolio management).  In this article, we shall compute standard deviation of a portfolio using tools from linear algebra. Before we jump to portfolio management it is good to recall certain basic concepts from linear algebra.
